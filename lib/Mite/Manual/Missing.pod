    package Your::Project::Class;
    use Your::Project::Mite;
    use Sub::HandlesVia;
    
    has numbers => (
        is          => 'lazy',
        builder     => sub { [] },
        isa         => 'ArrayRef[Int]',
        handles_via => 'Array',
        handles     => {
            add_number => 'push',
            pop_number => 'pop',
        },
    );
