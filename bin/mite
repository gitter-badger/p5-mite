=head1 NAME

mite - A Perl OO compiler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cd Your-Project
    mite init Your-Project
    ...write code with use Your::Project::Mite...
    mite compile


=head1 DESCRIPTION

mite is a Perl compiler for L<Mite>, a Moose-like module for doing
object oriented code.  Unlike others, code using Mite has no
dependencies, I<even on Mite itself>.

mite allows you to write object-oriented Perl modules without any
dependencies.  There is also no startup cost to build the classes,
they are already built.

mite compiles not into C, but into more Perl.  Each .pm file which
uses Mite will have an associated .mite.pm file which contains the
additional code implementing the class.  This is pure Perl code and
will load as fast as any other Perl.

=head1 COMMANDS

=head2 init
